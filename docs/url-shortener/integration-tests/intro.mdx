# Integration Tests

[Integration tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) check how multiple components work together as a whole. Instead of focusing on testing individiual components like a **unit test**, they push realistic inputs through the system to confirm the resulting behavior matches what users expect.

Our unit tests cover the individual pieces of the **shortener service**, but it's a good idea to ensure those components behave correctly once the server receives a real **HTTP request**, which is routed to the handler.

To run the tests for this:

```sh
go test ./internal/api
```

## Covered Scenarios

- `TestShortenHandlerSuccess` — exercises the flow of a user creating a **short URL** based on a **long URL**.
- `TestRedirectHandlerSuccess` — exercises the redirect flow for users clicking on the **short URL**.
