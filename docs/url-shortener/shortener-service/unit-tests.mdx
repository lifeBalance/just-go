# Unit Tests

The shortener service converts long URLs into unique short codes through the `Shorten` method defined in `/internal/services/shortener/shortener.go`. The automated tests in `/internal/services/shortener/shortener_test.go` cover both the service logic and the random code generator.

To run the tests for this service:

```sh
go test ./internal/services/shortener
```

<Admonition type="Run All Tests">
  To run the suite (aka, all the tests), execute `go test ./...` from the **root** of the project.
  The `...` means **all the tests**.
</Admonition>

## Happy Path

We need to test the normal success scenario, i.e. the flow where everything is valid, dependencies behave, and the code returns its intended result without triggering error handling. The `TestShortenSuccess` works like this:

- We create a **stub generator** that always emits the same **hardcoded short code**, so assertions can be precise.
- We pass a **valid URL**, guaranteeing the service runs its **success branch** instead of a validation error.
- The test then calls `Shorten`, expects no error, and checks that both the original URL and the short code in the response match the inputs and stub output

## Negative Tests

Negative tests are the ones that deliberately feed **invalid input** or **broken dependencies** into the code so we can confirm it fails in the expected way — returning the **right errors**, short-circuiting early. Here we are testing several things:

### URL Validation

`TestShortenValidation` tests that **empty** or **malformed URLs** trigger `ErrEmptyURL` and `ErrInvalidURL`, ensuring we reject bad requests before touching the generator.

### Generator Injection

`TestShortenNoGenerator` tests that instantiating the service without a generator returns `ErrNoGenerator`, and any error returned by the generator bubbles up unchanged.

### Generator Error

`TestShortenGeneratorError` swaps in a **stub generator** that always returns `errors.New("boom")`. A **valid URL** is sent through `Shorten`, the call is expected to **fail**, and the assertion checks that the very same error value bubbles back to the caller.

### Random Code Generator

`TestRandomCodeGeneratorGenerate` creates a generator with `NewRandomCodeGenerator(8)`, calls its `Generate` method, and then asserts two things:

- The resulting string has exactly **eight characters**
- Every rune belongs to the **allowed alphanumeric alphabet**.

This test picks up `RandomCodeGenerator` and checks its behavior in isolation, it’s a **pure unit test**.
