# Shortener Service Overview

In the previous **Setup Section**, we added the service, and wire it up in the **entry point** of the app, using **DI**. But if you check the code, we're just returning a hardcoded shortcode:

```go
return ShortenResponse{
    ShortCode:   "stub123",
    OriginalURL: req.URL,
}, nil
```

In this section we'll add the code responsible for turning **long URLs** into unique **short codes**.

## What the Service Does

- Accepts a **long URL** and returns a **short code** plus **metadata**.
- **Validates input** (non-empty, well-formed URLs) before delegating to storage.
- Coordinates with supporting components (random code generator, store, validator workers) via dependency injection.
