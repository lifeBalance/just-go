# Question 2

Once the main goroutine starts a background goroutine, what are some ways to cancel the background task? Walk us through:

- a real scenario where you needed cancellation
- how you signaled the goroutine to stop
- how you verified the goroutine actually exited

## Answers

The primary and idiomatic way in modern Go is using context.Context. You pass a cancellable context (from the HTTP request, or created manually) to the background goroutine. The goroutine then periodically checks if the context has been cancelled.
