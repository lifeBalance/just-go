# Question 5

Tell us about a time you improved test coverage or caught a bug through better test design. Walk us through: 

- what was undertested or what bug slipped through - how you restructured the tests (table-driven, subtests, mocking, etc.)
- what edge cases you added 
- how this prevented future regressions 
- how to catch data race *
