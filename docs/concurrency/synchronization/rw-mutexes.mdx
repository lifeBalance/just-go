# Read-Write Mutexes (`sync.RWMutex`)

Optimized locks that allow multiple readers OR one writer. Better performance when reads are more frequent than writes.

**Best for**: Read-heavy data structures like caches, configuration data

```go
var mu sync.RWMutex
mu.RLock()      // Multiple readers can hold this
data := cache[key]
mu.RUnlock()
```
