# Scheduler

The scheduler is the part of the operating system (or runtime) that decides which thread or process runs at any given moment. Because the CPU can only execute one instruction stream per core at a time, the scheduler slices time among all runnable tasks—starting, stopping, and resuming them so everyone gets a fair shot at progress.
