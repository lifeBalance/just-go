# Variable Scope

In the previouse section we saw how declaring a variable using the `:=` shorthand syntax is only allowed inside functions. That implies that we can also declare variables outside functions, using the `var` keyword.

Variables in Go can have different **scope levels** depending on where they are declared:

- **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a **function** or a **block** (like an `if` statement or a loop) are only accessible within that block.
- **Package Scope**: Variables declared at the package level (outside any function) are accessible throughout the entire package.

## Block Scope

Here's an example of block scope:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    if true {
        blockVar := "I'm inside an if block"
        fmt.Println(blockVar) // ✅ Accessible here
    }
    fmt.Println(blockVar) // ❌ Error: blockVar is not accessible here
}
```

## Package Scope

Here's an example of package scope:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var packageVar string = "I'm a package-level variable"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(packageVar) // ✅ Accessible here
}
```

It's not a good practice to overuse package-level variables, as they can make the code harder to maintain and understand. It's generally better to keep variables scoped as narrowly as possible.

### Exporting Package-Level Variables

In Go, if a package-level variable starts with an **uppercase letter**, it is **exported** and can be accessed from other packages. If it starts with a lowercase letter, it is unexported and can only be accessed within the same package.

```go
package somepackage

var ExportedVar string = "I'm exported"

var unexportedVar string = "I'm unexported"
```

Then from another package:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "somepackage"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(somepackage.ExportedVar) // ✅ Accessible
    fmt.Println(somepackage.unexportedVar) // ❌ Error: unexportedVar is not accessible
}
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Caution with Exported Variables">
Again, be cautious when using exported package-level variables, as they can lead to tight coupling between packages.
</Admonition>

It's fine to export **constants** to expose necessary data:

```go
package config

const APIKey string = "12345"
const BaseURL string = "https://api.example.com"
const DatabasePort int = 5432
```

## Shadowing

When a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, the inner variable **shadows** the outer one:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var name string = "Global Name" // Package-level variable

func main() {
    name := "Local Name" // Shadows the package-level variable
    fmt.Println(name)    // Outputs: Local Name
}
```
