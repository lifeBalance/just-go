# Introduction

In the previous sections we saw how variables can be created in two ways:

- Using an explicit syntax.
- Using a shorthand syntax.

In this section we'll go a bit deeper, and introduce new features related to variables and constants.

## Explicit Sintax

Creating variables using the explicity syntax it's a two step process:

```go
var username string // Declaration
username = "Bob"    // Assignment
```

1. The **first step** is known as **variable declaration**. Here we use the `var` keyword to announce that we'll be creating a variable, then we write the **name of the variable**, then its **type**.

2. In the **second step** we assign a value to the variable. Note that the value we assign must match the **type** of the variable we specified in the declaration.

Note that this syntax also allows to perform the assignment at the same time:

```go
var username string =  "Bob" // Declaration and Assignment
```

It's also possible to omit the type, in which case the Go compiler will infer the type from the value being assigned:

```go
var username = "Bob" // Look Ma, no type!
```

And we can **declare** multiple variables at the same time:

```go
var name1, name2 string
```

## Shorthand Syntax

Go offers a shorthand syntax that allows us to declare and assign values in a slightly shorter fashion:

```go
username := "Bob" // Declaration and Assignment
```

In this case we don't have to use the `var` keyword to announce that we're declaring a variable; the Go compiler is smart enough to infer the fact from the `:=` operator.
Also, the compiler is able to infer the **type** of the variable from the type of value we're using in the assignment.

<Admonition>
  The `:=` operator is known as the [short variable declaration
  operator](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations). In **Python**
  is known as the **walrus operator**.

The shorthand syntax `:=` can only be used **inside functions**. If you try to use it at the package level, you'll get a compilation error.

```go
package main

username := "Bob" // ❌ Error

func main() {
    username := "Bob" // ✅ Correct
}
```

<Admonition type="error" title="Syntax Error">
  Do not use the `:=` operator outside functions!
</Admonition>

## Constants

Variables can be reassigned new values (hence the name _variable_) using the **assignment operator** (`=`):

```go
username := "Bob"
username = "Robert" // Assign a new value
```

Constants in the other hand, cannot be reassigned:

```go
const username string = "Bob"
username = "Robert"             // ❌ Error!
```

## Multiple Assignment

Go allows us to assign several values at the same time:

```go
username1, username2 = "Bob", "Lisa"
```

This also works when we create the variables:

```go
var name1, name2 string = "Bob", "Lisa"
```

It works with **shorthand syntax**:

```go
name1, name2 := "Bob", "Lisa"
```

And it also works with **constants**:

```go
const name1, name2 string = "Bob", "Lisa"
```
