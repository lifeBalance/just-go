# Strings

A string in Go is sequences of characters. You can create strings using **double quotes**:

```go
var greeting string = "Hello, World!"
```

One limitation of using double quotes, interpreted string literals is that our string cannot span multiple lines. If you need a string that spans multiple lines, you can use **backticks**:

```go
var multiLine string = `This is a
multi-line string.`
```

The [predeclared identifier](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers) for all type of strings is `string`.

## String Literals

Strings defined in our programs directly (by typing the text), using either **double quotes** or **backticks** are known as [string literals](https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals). There are two types:

- String literals surrounded by double quotes are known as **interpreted string literals**.
- Multiline strings are known as **raw string literals**.

Interpreted string literals are the most commonly used, but raw string literals are useful for writing multiline messages, HTML, and regular expressions.

## Runes

Runes represent a single Unicode character and are defined using **single quotes**:

```go
var letter rune = 'A'
```

In other languages, we can use single quotes for strings, but in Go, single quotes are used for rune literals (which represent a **single character**).

## Unicode and UTF-8

In Go, [strings](https://go.dev/ref/spec#String_types) are sequences of [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) characters. That means that we can use emojis in our strings:

```go
var greeting string = "Hello, 🌍!"
```

<Admonition type="info" title="UTF-8 and variable-width characters">
  **UTF-8** is the most widely used
  [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) encoding. Each Unicode
  character has a unique identifying number called a **code point** The UTF-8
  encoding is the standard encoding for text files, XML and JSON files. It uses
  between one and four bytes to represent each code point. **ASCII** is a subset
  of UTF-8, its code points use one byte.

In Go, each character in a string can use from 1 to 4 bytes depending on the character being stored. For example, whenever storing [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, only 1 byte is used per character. But for storing other characters, like emojis, more bytes are needed.

<Admonition type="info" title="Fixed-width characters">
  In other languages, such as C, strings are sequences of characters with
  exactly **1 byte**. ASCII is by far the most common character set used in C
  implementations, and faces the limitation of being able to represent only 128
  different characters. This is not the case in Go, where strings are sequences
  of **bytes** that can represent a much larger set of characters thanks to
  UTF-8 encoding.

## Accessing Characters in a String

You can access individual characters in a string using **indexing**. The index of the first character is `0`, the second character is at index `1`, and so on. For example:

```go
var greeting string = "Hello, World!"
firstChar := greeting[0] // 'H'
secondChar := greeting[1] // 'e'
```

In Go, strings are **immutable**, meaning that once created, it is impossible to change any of its characters:

```go
greeting[0] = 'h' // ❌ This will result in a compilation error
```

A string may consist of an **empty sequence of characters**, what is known as an **empty string**.

## Escape sequences

String literals support embedding **escape sequences**, which are characters with special meaning. The table below lists some of them:

| Escape       | Meaning                                                           |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\\`         | Backslash \                                                       |
| `\ooo`       | Unicode character with the given 3-digit 8-bit octal code point   |
| `\'`         | Single quote (‘); only allowed inside character literals          |
| `\"`         | Double quote (”); only allowed inside interpreted string literals |
| `\a`         | ASCII bell (BEL)                                                  |
| `\b`         | ASCII backspace (BS)                                              |
| `\f`         | ASCII formfeed (FF)                                               |
| `\n`         | ASCII linefeed (LF)                                               |
| `\r`         | ASCII carriage return (CR)                                        |
| `\t`         | ASCII tab (TAB)                                                   |
| `\uhhhh`     | Unicode character with the given 4-digit 16-bit hex code point    |
| `\Uhhhhhhhh` | Unicode character with the given 8-digit 32-bit hex code point    |
| `\v`         | ASCII vertical tab (VT)                                           |
| `\xhh`       | Unicode character with the given 2-digit 8-bit hex code point     |
