# Numeric Types

Go has several different types to represent numbers, which can be grouped into two categories:

* Integer numbers.
* Floating-point numbers.

```go
var count int = 100            // Integer type
var price float64 = 19.99      // Floating-point type
```

## Integers

Integer numbers are, like in maths, numbers without a decimal component. In mathematics, the set of integers consists of:

* The number **zero** (0)
* The **natural numbers** (1, 2, 3, ...)
* And the **negative integers** (−1, −2, −3, ...)

In math, the set of integer numbers is countably **infinite** but, in computer science we are constrained by the size of the memory. That means that integers are a data type that represents a finite subset of the mathematical integers.

In Go we have several integer types which we can classify in 4 groups:

1. **Unsigned integers**, in other words all positive numbers. We can differentiate 4 types in this group:

  * `uint8` - the set of all unsigned 8-bit integers (0 to 255)
  * `uint16` - the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
  * `uint32` - the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
  * `uint64` - the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

2. **Signed integers**, also 4 types in this group:

  * `int8` - the set of all signed 8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
  * `int16` - the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
  * `int32` - the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
  * `int64` - the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

3. There are also two **alias types**:

  * `byte` - which is the same as `uint8`, so can be used to represent binary data or ASCII characters.
  * `rune` - which is an alias for `int32`, and can be used to represent Unicode code points (1 to 4 bytes).

  Except these last 2 types, all numeric types are different so conversions are required when different numeric types are mixed in an expression or assignment.

4. Finally, there are also 3 **machine dependent** integer types. `uint`, `int` and `uintptr`. They are machine dependent because their size depends on the type of architecture you are using.

Generally speaking if you are working with integers you should just use the `int` type.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Just use int">
For general use, the type `int` is recommended over the other integer types. The same stands for `uint`, in case you need unsigned integers.
</Admonition>

## Integer Aliases

- `byte` is an alias of `uint8`. Commonly used for raw bytes (binary data) and ASCII.
- `rune` is an alias of `int32`. Represents a single Unicode code point.

<Admonition type="info" title="More on runes and text">
`rune` usage and Unicode details (iteration, decoding, printing) are covered in the [Strings](./strings) section.

## Floats

For representing [floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Floating-point_numbers) we have two types:

- `float32` the set of all [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) 32-bit floating-point numbers.
- `float64` the set of all **IEEE 754** 64-bit floating-point numbers.
