# Introduction

Go is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking) language, which means that variables can only hold the type of data we specified during the declaration. We can categorize Go's [types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types) in four main groups.

## Basic types

The most basic types in Go are:

* [Strings](https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_types)
* [Numeric types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types)
* [Booleans](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types)

The [boolean type](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types) only contains two values denoted by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The [predeclared identifier](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers) for the boolean type is `bool`.

## Aggregate types

**Aggregate types** are those types formed by aggregating or concatenating a bunch of other values. These values are stored in memory next to each other.

* [Arrays](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Array_types)
* [Structs](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types)

Both of these types are **value types**, meaning that when we assign or pass an array or a struct, Go copies the entire value. Changes to the copy don't affect the original. The difference between both of these types is:

- **Arrays** store elements of the same type. These elements are ordered by an integer number which express their position in the array.
- The elements in a **struct** doesn't have to be of the same type. Elements in a struct are not ordered, and they're indexed by key.

## Reference types

Reference types are those types that do not store the actual value, but a reference (or pointer) to the value stored somewhere else in memory. When we assign or pass them, you copy the reference, not the data. Multiple variables can point to the same underlying data.

* [Pointers](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Pointer_types)
* [Slices](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Slice_types)
* [Maps](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Map_types)
* [Functions](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Function_types)
* [Channels](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Channel_types)

## Interface types

An [interface](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types) is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. A variable of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
