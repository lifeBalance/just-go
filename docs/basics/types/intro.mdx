# Introduction

Go is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking) language, which means that variables can only hold the type of data we specified during the declaration. We can categorize Go's [types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types) in four main groups.

## Basic types

The most basic types in Go are:

* [Strings](https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_types)
* [Numeric types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types)
* [Booleans](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types)

The [boolean type](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Boolean_types) only contains two values denoted by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The [predeclared identifier](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers) for the boolean type is `bool`.

## Aggregate types

**Aggregate types** are those types formed by aggregating or concatenating a bunch of other values of the same type. These values are stored in memory next to each other.

* [Arrays](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Array_types)
* [Structs](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types)

As we'll see when we get to the dedicated section, both arrays and structs are **fixed size**, whereas their dynamic equivalents (slices and maps) can grow in size as needed.

## Reference types

Reference types are those types that do not store the actual value, but a reference (or pointer) to the value stored somewhere else in memory.

* [Pointers](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Pointer_types)
* [Slices](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Slice_types)
* [Maps](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Map_types)
* [Functions](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Function_types)
* [Channels](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Channel_types)

## Interface types

An [interface](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types) is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. A variable of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
