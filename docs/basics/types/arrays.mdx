# Arrays

In Go, an array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They have a **fixed size**, which means that once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.

## Declaring and Initializing Arrays

Arrays can created like other variables, using the `var` keyword. You specify the type of elements and the number of elements required by enclosing the number in square brackets.

```go
var numbers [5]int // Declares an array of 5 integers
var names [3]string = [3]string{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"} // Declares and initializes an array of 3 strings
```
