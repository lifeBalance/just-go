# Functions

In Go, [functions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Function_types) are [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen), which means that supports all the operations generally available to other entities. For example:

- They can be assigned to **variables** and **fields** and call them later.
- We can pass them around as **arguments** and **return values** from functions.


- Anonymous functions and closures: functions capture surrounding variables by reference.
- Named function types: `define type Handler func(...)` and even attach methods to that named type.
- Use in goroutines: `go func() { ... }()` runs concurrently.


: higher-order functions work naturally.
