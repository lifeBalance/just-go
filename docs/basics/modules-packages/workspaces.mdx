# Workspaces

Use `go work` to develop multiple modules locally without editing `replace` lines.

```bash
go work init ./app ./lib
# Add/remove modules
go work use ./tools
go work edit -dropreplace github.com/you/oldlib
```

- Workspace resolves imports across listed modules.
- Keep `go.work` at the repo root for local dev only; commit it if you want to share the workspace setup with teammates.
