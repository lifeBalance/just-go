# Modules & Packages

A [module](https://go.dev/ref/mod) is a versioned collection of code managed by `go.mod`. A [package](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Packages) is a directory of Go files compiled together and imported by path.

<Admonition variant="tip" title="Keep it simple">
Start with a single module per repo. Add subpackages as the project grows.
