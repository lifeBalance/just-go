# Local Development

## replace for local modules

```go
module github.com/you/app

require github.com/you/lib v0.0.0
replace github.com/you/lib => ../lib
```

## Workspaces (go.work)

```bash
go work init ./app ./lib
go work use ./tools
```

- Helps develop multiple modules together locally.
- `go build` resolves imports across the workspace.
