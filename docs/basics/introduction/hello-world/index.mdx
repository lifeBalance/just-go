# Hello World

Nothing like the good old [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to break the ice in any programming language. First of all, let's create a folder named `hello` to hold our project; inside we'll create a file named `main.go`:

```
hello/
    └── main.go
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  You can name the file anything you want, but `main.go` is a common convention
  for the main entry point of a Go program.
</Admonition>

Here's what `main.go` looks like:

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" />

To execute this code, we can open a terminal and change into the project folder (`cd hello`); once there, we have to run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
Hello, world!       # 👈 This is the output ✅
```

That's it! You've just written and executed your first Go program 🎉

<Admonition type="info" title="How it works">
  [go](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go) is a tool to manage Go source code. The `run`
  command compiles and runs the named `main` Go package. You can run `go help`
  to learn more about the available commands.

## Structure of a Go Program

Let's break down the code in `main.go` to understand how programs are structured in Go.

### Declaring Packages

In Go, every file begins with a `package` declaration, that it's a way of grouping all the files in the same directory under a given name. In this case we're using the name `main`, which tells the compiler that this file should be compiled as part of an **executable program**.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={1} />

This program only contains one file, but as we start writing more complex applications using multiple files, packages help us organize our code better.

<Admonition type="important">
  Every **executable** Go program must have a `main` package.
</Admonition>

If we were to create a library instead, we would use a different package name.

### Importing Packages

Packages are declared, so that other parts of our application can use the code defined in them. To use code from other packages, we need to import them using the `import` statement.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={3} />

Go has a rich standard library, filled with predefined packages,which we can import and use into our programs. In our example, we imported the [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) package, which provides functions for formatted I/O, including printing to the console.

<Admonition type="tip">
  The Go ecosystem has a vast number of third-party packages available for
  various tasks. We can search for available packages in the
  [https://pkg.go.dev/](https://pkg.go.dev) site.
</Admonition>

### The main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program. When you run the program, execution starts from this function.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={[5, 6, 7]} />

<Admonition type="important">
  Every executable Go program must have a `main` function in the `main` package. But not all programs have to be executable; **libraries**, for example, don't need a `main` function.
</Admonition>

### Printing to the Console

In a previous section we explained how we imported the [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) package. Once such a package has been imported, we can access any of its functionality by using **dot notation**, i.e. the **name of the package**, followed by the **name of the function** we want to use:

```
<package>.<function>
```

The [fmt.Println](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@go1.25.4#Println) prints any string of text we pass as an argument (in this case `Hello, world!`) to the console.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={6} />

If you don't want a **newline** at the end of the text, you could use the [fmt.Print](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@go1.25.4#Print) function.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using a proper **code editor** such as VSCode, you should be able of writing `fmt`, press the **tab key** (or whatever is your shortcut for autocompletion), and the editor automatically writes the import statement for you.

  Also, once the package is imported, you should be able of writing `fmt.` and get a list of all the available functions in that package. Leveraging your code editor's autocompletion feature is essential for a few reasons:
  - Avoid typos in the function names.
  - It's a great way to learn more about the functions included in a package.
  - It speeds up your coding process.
