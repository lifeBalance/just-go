# Hello World

Nothing like the good old [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to break the ice in any programming language. First of all, let's create a folder named `hello` to hold our project; inside we'll create a file named `main.go`:

```
hello/
    └── main.go
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  You can name the file anything you want, but `main.go` is a common convention
  for the main entry point of a Go program.
</Admonition>

Here's what `main.go` looks like:

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" />

To execute this code, we can open a terminal and change into the project folder (`cd hello`); once there, we have to run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
Hello, world!       # 👈 This is the output ✅
```

That's it! You've just written and executed your first Go program 🎉

<Admonition type="info" title="How it works">
  [go](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go) is a tool to manage Go source code. The `run`
  command compiles and runs the named `main` Go package. You can run `go help`
  to learn more about the available commands.

## Packages

In Go, every file begins with a `package` declaration, that it's a way of grouping all the files in the same directory under a given name. In this case we're using the name `main`, which tells the compiler that this file should be compiled as part of an **executable program**.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={1} />

<Admonition type="important">
  Every **executable** Go program must have a `main` package.
</Admonition>

If we were to create a library instead, we would use a different package name.

## Importing Packages

Go has a rich standard library, and you can also import **third-party packages**. In our example, we imported the [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) package, which provides functions for formatted I/O, including printing to the console.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={3} />

We can search for available packages in the [https://pkg.go.dev/](https://pkg.go.dev) site.

## The main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program. When you run the program, execution starts from this function.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={[5, 6, 7]} />

<Admonition type="important">
  Every executable Go program must have a `main` function in the `main` package.
</Admonition>

## Printing to the Console

Inside the `main` function, we used [fmt.Println](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@go1.25.4#Println) to print the text `Hello, world!` to the console.

<Code code={mainHelloWorld} lang="go" title="main.go" mark={6} />

This function adds a **newline** at the end of the output.
