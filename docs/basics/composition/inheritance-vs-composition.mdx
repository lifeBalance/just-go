## Inheritance vs Composition

In object-oriented languages like Java, you use inheritance to share behavior between classes. For example:

```java
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

Dog dog = new Dog();

dog.eat();   // from Animal
dog.bark();  // from Dog
```

As you can see, since our `Dog` class inherits the class `Animal`, it also has access to its methods. Go doesn't have inheritance, instead, it uses **composition** which consists in building complex types by combining simpler ones.

> It's the principle of "has-a" relationships instead of "is-a" relationships found in inheritance.

## Embedding Types

In Go, you can embed one struct type into another. This allows the outer struct to access the fields and methods of the embedded struct directly.
So the example above in Go would look like this:

```go
type Animal struct {
    Name string
}

func (a Animal) Eat() {
    fmt.Println(a.Name, "is eating...")
}

type Dog struct {
    Animal  // 👈 embedded struct (no field name)
    Breed string
}

func (d Dog) Bark() {
    fmt.Println("Woof!")
}

func main() {
    dog := Dog{
        Animal: Animal{Name: "Buddy"},
        Breed:  "Golden Retriever",
    }

    dog.Eat()   // "Buddy is eating..."
    dog.Bark()  // "Woof!"

    fmt.Println(dog.Animal.Name)  // "Buddy"
    fmt.Println(dog.Name)         // "Buddy" (promoted field)
}
```

Note how we are composing our `Dog` type embedding the `Animal` type. That way we have access to its **fields** and **methods**.

<Admonition title="Promoted Fields and Methods">
  Note that when we embed a type, in this case `Animal`, we can access its
  fields and methods directly, without having to use double **dot notation**.
  Accessing them explicitely is **optional**.

**Java** says: "A Dog is an Animal" (**inheritance**)
**Go** says: "A Dog has Animal behavior" (**composition**)
