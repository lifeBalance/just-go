# Composition

The two most defining features of Go are **concurrency** and **composition**. Composition is a programming technique where complex types are built by combining simpler types, rather than inheriting from them. 

<Admonition type="info" title="Composition vs Inheritance">
  Composition is often contrasted with **inheritance**, which is a common feature in object-oriented programming languages such as Java.

In Go, composition is the primary mechanism for **code reuse** and type relationships since the language doesn't have classical inheritance.

## Types of Composition

There are two main ways to achieve composition in Go:

1. **Embedding Types**: You can embed one struct type into another, allowing the outer struct to access the fields and methods of the embedded struct directly.
2. **Interfaces**: Go uses interfaces to define behavior that can be shared across different types, allowing for flexible and decoupled code.
