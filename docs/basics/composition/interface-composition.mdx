# Interface Composition

This is where Go really shines. You compose behavior through interfaces:

```go
type Reader interface {
    Read() string
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(data string)
}

// ReadWriter composes two interfaces
type ReadWriter interface {
    Reader
    Writer
}

type File struct{}

func (f File) Read() string {
    return "file contents"
}

func (f File) Write(data string) {
    fmt.Println("Writing:", data)
}

func process(rw ReadWriter) {
    data := rw.Read()
    rw.Write(data)
}

func main() {
    file := File{}
    process(file)  // File satisfies ReadWriter
}
```

The `process` function accepts anything that satisfies `ReadWriter`, and since our `File` type implements both methods, we can pass it to this function. As you can see, using the `ReadWriter` interface we're making our `process` function more flexible; it can take as an argument any type that implements both `Read()` and `Write()`.
