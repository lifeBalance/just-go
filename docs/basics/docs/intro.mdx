# Documentation

The Go project [takes documentation seriously](https://go.dev/blog/godoc). Every Go installation includes the [godoc](https://go.dev/cmd/godoc/) documentation tool that automatically parses your [Go comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment) to extract documentation.

## Go Comments

[Go comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment) can be used at different levels of a project, to explain:

- Packages
- Commands
- Types
- Functions
- Constants
- Variables

Those comments live next to your source, but they can also be used to automatically generate proper **documentation** by using the [godoc](https://go.dev/cmd/godoc/) documentation tool .

## A Demo Project

This little module shows how documentation flows from package, to type, to method level. Save the files under a folder named `demo/` and run the commands listed in the top comment.

```
demo/
├── go.mod
├── cmd/
│   └── greet/
│       └── main.go
└── foo/
    └── foo.go
```

The `foo` package looks like this:

<Code code={demoPkgCode} lang="go" title="foo/foo.go" />

As you can see it includes:

- A `Greeter` struct type.
- A `DefaultMessage` ...

The purpose of all of these constructs is illustrated with helpful comments...


Then we have the `cmd/greet/main.go` file:

<Code code={demoCmdCode} lang="go" title="cmd/greet/main.go" />

Let's run this project and see how it works:

```sh
go run ...
```

## Accessing the Documentation

From inside `demo/`, we could access the documentation in the command line, by running:

```sh
go doc
```

The output would look like this:

```
output
```

We could also launch a local http server to explore our project docs in the browser:

```sh

```
