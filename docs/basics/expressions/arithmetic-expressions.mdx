# Arithmetic expressions

Arithmetic combines numeric operands with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`. The rules are simple and predictable; the few sharp edges are worth calling out.

- `+` adds, `-` subtracts, `*` multiplies.
- `/` divides. For integers, the result truncates toward zero.
- `%` is remainder. It works only with integers.

Operator quick reference:

| Operator | Meaning       | Notes                               |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `+`      | addition      |                                     |
| `-`      | subtraction   |                                     |
| `*`      | multiplication|                                     |
| `/`      | division      | Integers truncate toward zero       |
| `%`      | remainder     | Integers only                       |

```go
a := 7 / 2        // 3  (integer division truncates)
b := float64(7)/2 // 3.5 (a float operand makes it floating‑point)

r := 7 % 3        // 1   (remainder)
```

Go doesn’t do implicit numeric widening. If types differ, convert explicitly:

```go
var n int32 = 100
x := 2 * int64(n)   // convert before mixing
```

Untyped constants (like `42` or `3.14`) can adapt to a needed numeric type until you assign or convert them. That’s why this works without a cast:

```go
var m int64
m = 42      // untyped constant fits into int64
```

Overflow is defined for unsigned integers (wraparound modulo 2^N). Signed overflow is also well‑defined by Go’s two’s‑complement behavior, but you shouldn’t rely on wrap as an API — just know it won’t panic.

Operator precedence follows math (PEMDAS): multiplication/division bind tighter than addition/subtraction. Go has no exponent operator; use `math.Pow`. You can always use parentheses to make intent obvious:

```go
an := 2 + 3*4      // 14
bn := (2 + 3) * 4  // 20
```

For exact integer division with remainder, keep both values:

```go
q, r := 7/3, 7%3 // q=2, r=1
```

`%` requires integer operands. If you need a floating remainder, work with `math.Mod`.
