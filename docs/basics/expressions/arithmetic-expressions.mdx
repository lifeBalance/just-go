# Arithmetic expressions

[Arithmetic expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Arithmetic_expressions) perform calculations on numeric operands. Golang supports both integer and floating-point arithmetic. The following table contains the basic arithmetic operators:

| Operator | Meaning        | Example     |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `+`      | addition       | `2 + 2 = 4` |
| `-`      | subtraction    | `3 - 2 = 1` |
| `*`      | multiplication | `2 * 2 = 4` |
| `/`      | division       | `4 / 2 = 2` |
| `%`      | remainder      | `5 % 2 = 1` |

There's no **exponentiation operator**; use `math.Pow` for that.

## Operator Precedence

[Operator precedence](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operator_precedence) determines the order in which operations are performed. In Go, the operator precedence follows the PEMDAS rule:

1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents (via `math.Pow`, not an operator)
3. **M**ultiplication, Division, Remainder
4. **A**ddition, **S**ubtraction

For example:

```go
result := 2 + 3 * 4    // 14 (not 20)
// Multiplication happens first: 3 * 4 = 12, then 2 + 12 = 14
```

## Unary operators

Increment and decrement are statements (not expressions). Use them on integer variables only; they cannot appear inside larger expressions.

```go
i := 0
i++           // 1
i--           // 0
// fmt.Println(i++) // compile error: ++ used as value
```

## Compound assignment

Shorthand operators update a variable in place; `x += y` is the same as `x = x + y` (left side evaluated once).

| Operator | Meaning             | Example   |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| `+=`     | add and assign      | `n += 3`  |
| `-=`     | subtract and assign | `n -= 1`  |
| `*=`     | multiply and assign | `n *= 2`  |
| `/=`     | divide and assign   | `n /= 2`  |
| `%=`     | remainder and assign| `n %= 10` |
