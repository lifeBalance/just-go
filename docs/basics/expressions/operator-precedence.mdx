# Operator precedence

When you mix [operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators), precedence determines what operations are performed first. From higher to lower (within each group, left‑to‑right):

- Multiplicative: `* / % << >> & &^`
- Additive: `+ - | ^`
- Comparison: `== != < <= > >=`
- Logical AND: `&&`
- Logical OR: `||`

A couple quick checks:

```go
r1 := 2 + 3*4    // 14  (× before +)
r2 := (2 + 3) * 4// 20  (parentheses change it)

ok := a < b && b < c  // comparison binds before &&
```

**Parentheses** win every time. If in doubt, add them for clarity.

<Admonition variant="tip" title="Evaluation vs. precedence">
Precedence controls grouping; it does not change evaluation order. Operands and call arguments are still evaluated left‑to‑right, and `&&`/`||` still short‑circuit.
