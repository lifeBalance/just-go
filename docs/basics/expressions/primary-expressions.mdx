# Primary expressions

[Primary expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Primary_expressions) are the operands for unary and binary expressions. There are several types of primary expressions in Go:

- [Selectors](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Selectors)
- Index expressions
- Slice expressions
- Type assertions
- Calls

## Selectors

When we access the field or method of a **struct**, the result evaluates to some value, hence is a primary expression:

```go
bob := struct{
    name string
    age int
}{
    name: "Robert",
    age: 42,
}

fmt.Println(bob.name)
```

In the code above, `bob.name` is a selector which evaluates to whatever value is stored there. Once that's evaluated, `fmt.Println` will print it.

## Index Expressions

[Index expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Index_expressions) allow us to access elements within arrays, slices, strings, or maps.

```go
array[0]           // array/slice element
myMap["key"]       // map value
str[2]             // byte in string at index 2
```

## Slicing expressions

[Slicing expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Slice_expressions) are used to create slices from arrays, slices, or strings:

```go
array[1:4]         // elements from index 1 to 3
slice[:3]          // first 3 elements
slice[2:]          // from index 2 to end
slice[:]           // full slice
```

## Type Assertions

[Type Assertions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_assertions) are the expressions we use to retrieve the dynamic value of an interface.

```go
value := interfaceVar.(ConcreteType)
value, ok := interfaceVar.(ConcreteType)  // safe version
```

## Function and Method calls

Whenever a function or method returns a value, it's considered a expression:

```go
len("hello")           // evaluates to 5
strings.ToUpper("hi")  // evaluates to "HI"
math.Max(5, 10)        // evaluates to 10
```
