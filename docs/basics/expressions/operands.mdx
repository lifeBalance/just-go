# Operands

[Operands](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operands) are the basic building blocks used in expressions. They can be classified into several categories:

- **Literal values**, such as `5` or the string "hello"
- **[Identifiers](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Identifiers)** such as variables or constant names.
- [Parenthesized expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Primary_expressions), such as `(x + 5)`

The simplest expressions are **literal values**, no operators:

```go
42          // integer literal
3.14        // float literal
"hello"     // string literal
true        // boolean literal
'a'         // rune literal
```

Variables (or constants) by themselves are very simple expressions, that evaluate to their stored value. For example:

```go
x           // variable name
PI          // constant name
```

We can also combine literals and identifiers in parentheses:

```go
(x + 5)     // combination of identifier and literal value
```

Operands can not appear by themselves in a program, they must show up in some [statement](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Statements), like an assignment, a condition, etc.

```go
x := 10         // A literal in an assignment
y := x + 5      // A literal and a variable in an arithmetic expression
fmt.Println(y)  // An identifier as an argument to a function
```
