# Operators

[Operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators) combine primary expressions into larger expressions. You supply the operands; the operator does the work.

In Go, operands are evaluated left‑to‑right, and then the operator is applied. Logical `&&` and `||` short‑circuit (the right side may not run). Everything else evaluates both sides first.

This chapter is just the doorway. The specific families live in their own short sections:

- Arithmetic (`+ − * / %`)
- Comparison (`== != < <= > >=`)
- Boolean (`&& || !`)
- Bitwise and shifts (`& | ^ &^ << >>`)

<Admonition variant="tip" title="Operands come first">
If an expression already “is” a value — a selector, a call, a conversion, an index/slice, a function literal — it’s a primary expression. Operators work on those.
</Admonition>

A tiny taste, to set the tone:

```go
// Arithmetic
sum := 2 + 3*4       // 14
avg := float64(7)/2  // 3.5

// Comparison
ok := len(s) == 0

// Boolean (short‑circuit)
if s != nil && len(s) > 0 { /* safe */ }

// Bitwise & shifts
mask := 0b0101
x := 0b1111 &^ mask   // clear bits from mask → 0b1010
```

We’ll look at each family next, and finish with a small precedence page so you can predict what binds tighter when you mix them.
