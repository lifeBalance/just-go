# Operators

[Operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators) are used to combine primary expressions into larger expressions. The resulting expression evaluates to some value.

Operators in Go fall into several categories:

- [Arithmetic operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Arithmetic_operators) for performing mathematical calculations.
- [Comparison operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Comparison_operators) for comparing values.
- [Logical operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Logical_operators) for combining boolean expressions.
- [Integer operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Integer_operators) for bitwise manipulation and shifts.

Depending on the amount of operands they work with, operators can be classified as:

- **Unary operators**: work with a single operand (e.g., `-x`, `!flag`, `^mask`).
- **Binary operators**: work with two operands (e.g., `a + b`, `x < y`, `p && q`).

We’ll look at each family in the next sections.
