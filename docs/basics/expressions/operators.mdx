# Operators

[Operators](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators) are used to combine primary expressions into larger expressions. The resulting expression evaluates to some value.

Operators in Go fall into several categories:

- Arithmetic (`+ − * / %`)
- Comparison (`== != < <= > >=`)
- Boolean (`&& || !`)
- Bitwise and shifts (`& | ^ &^ << >>`)

Depending on the amount of operands they work with, operators can be classified as:

- **Unary operators**: work with a single operand (e.g., `-x`, `!flag`, `^mask`).
- **Binary operators**: work with two operands (e.g., `a + b`, `x < y`, `p && q`).

We’ll look at each family in the next sections.
