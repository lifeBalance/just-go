# Introduction

[Statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Statements) are the language constructs that we use for controlling the execution of a program. The Go documentation classifies them in several groups:

- [Terminating statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Terminating_statements)
- [Empty statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Empty_statements)
- [Expression statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Expression_statements)
- [Send statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Send_statements)
- [IncDec statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#IncDec_statements)
- [Assignment statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Assignment_statements)
- [If statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#If_statements)
- [Switch statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Switch_statements)
- [For statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#For_statements)
- [Go statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Go_statements)
- [Select statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Select_statements)
- [Return statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Return_statements)
- [Break statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Break_statements)
- [Continue statements](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Continue_statements)

We won't be following that classification, but feel free to check any of the items in that list if you need to.
