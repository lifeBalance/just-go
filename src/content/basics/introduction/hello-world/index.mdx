# Hello World

Nothing like the good old hello world to break the ice in any programming language. Here's what it looks like in Go:

<Code code={demo} language="go" title="hello.go" />

To run this code, save it in a file called `hello.go` and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run hello.go
Hello, world!
```

That's it! You've just written and executed your first Go program.

## Packages

In Go, every file begins with a `package` declaration. The `main` package is a special package that tells the Go compiler that this file should be compiled as an executable program. If you were to create a library instead, you would use a different package name.

```go
package main
```

## Importing Packages

Go has a rich standard library, and you can also import third-party packages. In our example, we imported the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O, including printing to the console.

```go
import "fmt"
```

## The main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program. When you run the program, execution starts from this function. Every executable Go program must have a `main` function in the `main` package.

```go
func main() {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## Printing to the Console

Inside the `main` function, we used `fmt.Println` to print "Hello, world!" to the console. The `Println` function adds a newline at the end of the output.

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
```
